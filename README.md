# Task 1 - ATM Interface
The "ATM Interface" is a Java-based console application that simulates an ATM system. Users can register, log in, and perform various banking operations including viewing transaction history, making withdrawals and deposits, transferring funds, and checking their account balance. This project not only demonstrates fundamental programming skills but also emphasizes real-world application development and problem-solving within financial software systems.

# Task 2 - Number Guessing Game
The "Number Guessing Game" is a Java project where players guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Players receive feedback if their guess is too high or too low, with a limited number of attempts to guess correctly. The game features multiple rounds and scoring based on the number of attempts.
